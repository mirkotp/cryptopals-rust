# cryptopals-rust

My own solutions to the [Cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com), in Rust language.

Run a challenge with `cargo run --bin sXXeXX` (replace `XX` with the desired set and challenge number). Launch tests with `cargo test`.

Exercises are in `./src/bin`, many common functions are in lib files under `./src`. Input files are in the `./res` directory.
